# customer-churn-prediction

## Problem Statement:
• In telecom domain where the customer acquisition has higher cost than customer retention and where there is a rampant price war, it becomes
important to predict and profile the customer behavior and predict them so that offers can be rolled out to retain them prior to switching.
• Data consist of the various behavior of customers and the last column states if the customer is still with the existing telecom company or not.
## Objectives:
• With the help of data visualization & descriptive stats help us understand the current state and various factors (or combination of factors) which
is contributing to customer churn.
• Develop a prediction algorithm to predict customer churn.
• Explain how you evaluated the model and which metric you chose for your model evaluation and why?
• What extra features could have made the model better and give a better explanation of the factors leading to churn
• Based on the descriptive analytics and model results help us to come up with a strategy to arrest customer churn.
## Deliverables:
• Code (ipython notebook or RMarkdown notebook)
• PPT explaining the overall approach(starting from current state to why your model should be used) and the strategy of arresting customer churn
